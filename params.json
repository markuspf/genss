It creates a\r\nsubdirectory called 'genss'.\r\n\r\nThis is all which is needed if you installed the package in the standard\r\n'pkg' subdirectory.\r\n\r\nNote that the genss package needs the 'orb' package to work.\r\n\r\nIf you installed the package in another 'pkg' directory than the standard\r\n'pkg' directory in your GAP 4 installation, then you have to add the path\r\nto the directory containing your 'pkg' directory to GAP's list of directories.\r\nThis can be done by starting GAP with the '-l' command line option\r\nfollowed by the name of the directory and a semicolon. Then your directory\r\nis prepended to the list of directories searched. Otherwise the package \r\nis not found by GAP. Of course, you can add this option to your GAP\r\nstartup script.\r\n\r\nRecompiling the documentation is possible by the command `gap makedoc.g'\r\nin the genss directory. But this should not be necessary.\r\n\r\nE-mail us if there are any questions, remarks, suggestions. Also, we\r\nwould like to hear about applications of this package.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Max Neunhoeffer, e-mail: neunhoef@mcs.st-and.ac.uk\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n  Felix Noeske, e-mail: felix.noeske@math.rwth-aachen.de\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
